**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

Notes:
- Please do not make support requests on Github. Our issue tracker is for tracking bugs and feature requests only. If you need help configuring the emulator please make a [request on our forums](https://forums.pcsx2.net/index.php) or contact us on [discord](https://discord.com/invite/TCz3t9k). If you are unsure, start with discord or the forums.
- We only accept bug reports for the latest dev version. Please try upgrading before making an issue.
- Please make an effort to make sure your issue isn't already reported.
- We are not accepting bug reports for PSX mode at this time. If you are interested in helping contribute to PSX mode please do so on the [forums](https://forums.pcsx2.net/index.php). Otherwise our recommendation is that you use a proper [PSX emulator](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/PlayStation_emulators).
- We do not accept issues relating to upscaling at this time. We are aware of the various problems with upscaling which spans many games and having hundreds of issues for the same fundamental issues isn't particularly helpful. There are several workarounds for graphical problems that come as a result of upscaling. Please try your game at native resolution before creating an issue and if your bug is the result of upscaling please use the [forums](https://forums.pcsx2.net/index.php) or [discord](https://discord.com/invite/TCz3t9k) for assistance with various upscaling workarounds. Additionally, the [Unofficial PCSX2 Wiki](https://wiki.pcsx2.net/Main_Page) often lists various fixes for upscaling issues.
- Please make sure your system meets our [requirements](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2#system-requirements) for OS version, CPU and GPU. We do not accept bug reports for unsupported operating systems. Performance issues as a result of not meeting our hardware requirements are not valid. Please read our known issues pages for [AMD](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/wiki/OpenGL-and-AMD-GPUs---All-you-need-to-know) and [Intel](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/wiki/OpenGL-and-Intel-GPUs-All-you-need-to-know) drivers.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**GS Settings**
Any non-default settings for GS. If you don't want to list them out, please provide screenshots of your configuration window (including hw hacks if enabled)
